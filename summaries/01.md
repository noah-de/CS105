# Preliminaries

## Why Study Programming Languages
  - Grasp of a language enables a greater capacity for expression. 
     - A person can only comprehend and convey that which they can also
       describe.
  - Can choose the appropriate language for a project by having the required
    background knowledge
  - More readily able to learn new languages
  - Better understanding of the consequences of implementation decisions
  - Improved eloquence in previously known languages
  - Informed decision makers improve the computing industry
    - Better software comes from using the right tool for the job

## Programming Domains
The following are the main areas of computing and some samples of languages
that serve those domains.

*Scientific Applications* (beginning in 1940s) 
  - simple data structures, large numbers
  - arrays & matrices
  - loops & selections
  - Fortran, ALGOL 60

*Business Applications* (beginning in 1950s)
  - elaborate reports, precise ways of storing decimals and characters
  - ability to specify decimal arithmetic
  - COBOL

*Artificial Intelligence (AI)*
  - emphasis on symbolic (rather than numeric) computations
  - linked lists (rather than arrays)
  - Lisp dominates this area
  - Some AI work has been done in C, Prolog and Scheme
