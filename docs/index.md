Welcome to CS105. 

By this point in your journey you have already written software for projects and are familiar with a few programming languages. This course will combine theory and practice to give you a more robust set of criteria to evaluate programming languages. _We will be learning about programming languages though the eyes of a designer/builder of programming languages._ This is a critical skill if your career takes you in a direction where you will develop compilers. With the perspective gained from this class you will be better equipped to learn new programming languages and you will gain comparative insight into the programming languages you already know.

We can anticipate a rich learning experience from the input of an involved class. This wiki is a way that you can write down notes from reading (to share with the class) or maintain your own private fork. if you successfully correct a mistake, you can earn participation points without having to speak in front of the class!

There will be lectures, discussions, quizzes, in-class assignments and a group project.

Right now this is just a collection of markdown files, but we should be able to utilize the features of [jekyl](https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages) if needed.
