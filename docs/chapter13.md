# Concurrency

Concurrency in software execution can happen at four different levels:

1. **Instruction Level**: Executing two or more machine instructions at the same time. 
2. **Statement Level**: Executing two or more high-level language statements at the same time.
3. **Unit Level**: Executing two or more subprograms at the same time.
4. **Program Level**: Executing two or more programs at the same time. 

_the book mentions that Python does not support concurrency, but you can write [concurrent software in Python](https://github.com/noah-de/swel/blob/master/References/parallel_execution.py)_:
